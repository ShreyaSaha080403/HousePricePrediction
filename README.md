## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShreyaSaha080403/HousePricePrediction.git
   cd HousePricePrediction
## Data

### Data Scraping

The data scraping script `magicbricks_scrap.py` retrieves real estate data from Magicbricks.

### Data Preprocessing

The notebook `magicbricks_data.ipynb` preprocesses the scraped data to prepare it for model training.

## Model

The machine learning model is developed in `model.ipynb` using the preprocessed data.

## Results

Predictions can be made using the trained model (`xgbreg.pkl`) on new data.
